# The Immutable Framework

Create immutable webapps that are secure and resilient.

```bash
npm i @hazae41/immutable
```

## Philosophy

Our philosophy is to build webapps that are as immutable as native apps but benefit from the wide distribution of the web. Such apps are built with strong client-side and offline capabilities. Once downloaded they should be immutably cached and only be updated when the user requests it or has opted-in automatic updates.

### Why?

Security and resilience. An immutable webapp is not prone to server-side attacks (e.g. DNS attack, BGP attack, TLS attack). An immutable webapp is always available to its users even if the server is compromised or censored. An immutable webapp can be distributed by other means than a centralized server (e.g. IPFS).

### How?

New and smart engineering techniques. The extensive use of service-workers and new web APIs allow us to build such apps. We leverage `Cache-Control`, `Fetch API` and `Crypto API` to distribute and cache webapps immutably. We improve and merge already existing frameworks such as `Next.js` and `Workbox` to fit exactly our needs.

## Usage

You can integrate the immutable framework to an existing client-side webapp. Or you can start a new one from the starter example webapp.
