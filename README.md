# The Immutable Framework

Create immutable webapps that are secure and resilient.

npm i @hazae41/immutable

## Philosophy

Our philosophy is to build webapps that are as immutable as native apps but benefit from the wide distribution of the web. Such webapps are built with strong client-side and offline capabilities. Once downloaded they should be immutably cached and only be updated when the user requests it or has opted-in automatic updates.

### Why?

Security and resilience. An immutable webapp is not prone to server-side attacks (e.g. DNS attack, BGP attack, TLS attack). An immutable webapp is always available to its users even if the server is compromised or censored. An immutable webapp can be distributed by other means than a centralized server (e.g. IPFS).

### How?

New and smart engineering techniques. The extensive use of service-workers and new web APIs allow us to build such webapps. We leverage `Cache-Control`, `Fetch API` and `Crypto API` to distribute and cache webapps immutably. We improve and merge already existing frameworks such as `Next.js` and `Workbox` to fit exactly our needs.

## Technology

The most important thing about The Immutable Framework is that service-workers are immutably cached.

This is done by using immutable `Cache-Control` headers and `{ updateViaCache: "all" }` options.

Once the service-worker is cached, the webapp cannot be automatically updated by the browser.

In order to update it, we need to `register()` a new service-worker at a different URL.

This is done by generating a `service_worker.<version>.js` for each version of your service-worker.

The webapp runtime fetches `service_worker.latest.js` and check its hash in order to detect updates.

If an update is detected, it can `register()` the new `service_worker.<version>.js` file.

Thus the developer or user is in control of when to update the webapp (e.g. a yes/no/always button).

-

The other great thing is that all other files are also immutably cached by the service-worker.

This is done just like `workbox` but with even more checks as the hashes are also verified.

All files are hashed and verified using SHA-256 which is both strong and fast.

-

The Immutable Framework also does things right to avoid server-side attacks at much as possible.

It is compatible with [HTTPSec](https://github.com/hazae41/httpsec), which means the HTML page can be automatically verified.

Unfortunately, you have to manually hash the service-worker to verify it because HTTPSec can't do that for you.

And since the service-worker verifies the hashes of other files (pages, scripts, assets).

That means you don't need to manually verify the hash of other files!

So the the only way to compromise the webapp is when you first download it.

But if you also use HTTPSec, then it can only compromise non-script assets.

Otherwise you can trust the whole webapp forever unless you update it!

-

Updates are tricky since you can't really verify them before applying them.

An update will be able to use the storage and cookies before the user can erase them.

One thing possible is to clear the storage just before a new service-worker is activated.

Or encrypt it with an user-password and prompting that password after the update.

So the user is able to manually verify the new service-worker before entering his password.
